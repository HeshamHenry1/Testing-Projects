# 🤖 Automation Testing Projects

This section of the repository showcases my automation testing projects using leading frameworks such as **Playwright**, **WebDriverIO**, and **Cypress**. Each subfolder contains end-to-end test flows, page objects, and test reports where applicable.

These projects reflect both learning exercises and near real-world scenarios across different domains (e-commerce, banking, UI validation).
